**Documentation**
- For Data Fetching we used React built in context api so then we dont have to do
  props drilling and flight data is available throught the component
- Built Reuseable UI components and Reuseable Form components as controlled-component so that
  we dont make our code repeated
- For modular and clean approach I keep the components smaller and ignore repeated
- FlightList component is the data that render on pressing of the button, initialy the
  dataset rendered is empty after the search button is pressed the data is being parsed and rendered


*total spend time on it is 5 hours, as it used most modular and maintainde cleanliness*
